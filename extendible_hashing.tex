\begin{document}

% This diagram is essentially a sideways tree, with height 1.
% The structure is something like this:
%
%      h(424)=0
% 0 /
% 1 /  h(109)=5
% 2 -  h(132)=4
% 3    h(244)=4
%   \
%      h(775)=7
%
% Note that 0 and 1 point to h(424)=0.

  \begin{center}
    % Show the hashing function
    \[ h(k) = k \bmod{8} \]

    % Now we draw the picture, with the following options:
    % - grow the tree from left to right (instead of top to bottom)
    % - set up the distance/spacing for the first child level
    % - don't draw the default edges
    % - define the "pointer" and "dpointer" edges, which differ in length
    % - set up styles for ever label and every node
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      grow=right,
      level 1/.style={sibling distance=2.5cm,level distance=3cm},
      edge from parent/.style={draw=none},
      pointer/.style={thick, shorten >=5pt, ->,draw=black},
      dpointer/.style={thick, shorten >=15pt, ->,draw=black},
      every label/.style={font=\footnotesize,draw=none},
      every node/.style={rectangle,thick,draw=black, text ragged, inner sep=2mm,minimum width=10mm}
      ]

      % Draw the root node, give it the id "directory"
      % There is a label above the node, and the node is a rectangle split into 4 parts, each with a label (eg one) and contents (eg 0).
      \node[label=above:{$d=2$},rectangle split, rectangle split parts=4] (directory) {
        \nodepart{one} 0
        \nodepart{two} 1
        \nodepart{three} 2
        \nodepart{four} 3
      }
      % The node has three children
      % Note that the first child is at the bottom, while the last is at the top
      % This corresponds to a regular tree (first=left) rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise

        % This is semantically the last child, so it goes on the bottom
        % But because of the ordering, we have to list it first

        % We're using the macro we defined previously:
        % k_B = 2, one part, the id is c, and the contents are "h(775)=7"

        % For the second child, note how \nodepart acts as a separator
        % Warning: There must not be any blank lines between these children, otherwise we get a child of a child instead of siblings.
        child {
          \block{2}{1}{c}{ $h(775)=7$ }
        }
        child {
          \block{2}{3}{b}{ $h(109)=5$ \nodepart{second} $h(132)=4$ \nodepart{third} $h(244)=4$ }
        }
        child {
          \block{1}{1}{a}{ $h(424)=0$ }
        };

      % Now we set up the pointers

      % directory.one refers to the rectangular part "one" within the "directory" node. We draw an edge from its east (right) side to node a's west (left).
      % Use the edge style dpointer, because we have a double pointer to node a. dpointer is shorter than pointer, so it'll look nicer.
      \path(directory.one east) edge [dpointer] (a.west);
      \path(directory.two east) edge [dpointer] (a.west);
      \path(directory.three east) edge [pointer] (b.west);
      \path(directory.four east) edge [pointer] (c.west);
    \end{tikzpicture}
