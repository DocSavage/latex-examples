LaTeX Examples
==============

The aim of this repository is to organize, collect, and share a variety of
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) templates that I have used, most likely
from old assignments.

To avoid academic integrity issues, I will be modifying assignments before
posting them. I will also try to ensure that all content is nevertheless
correct.

There is currently no planned structure or hierarchy in this repository, since
I'm adding examples as I use them. When things start getting unwieldy, I will
start organizing examples into directories.

Current Examples

Usage
-----

1. [Download and install LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html), if you
   don't already have it. If you don't know LaTeX, the
   [wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a good place to start.
   After that, [The Not So Short Introduction
   LaTeX2e](http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf) is also a good resource.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Use `pdflatex` to compile the examples
4. ???
5. Profit.

Contributing
------------

One of my goals here is to collect other examples, especially since I am still
learning LaTeX.

If you would like to contribute (adding new examples, fixing mistakes,
suggesting alternatives, etc), please send me a pull request.

For now, please let me handle directories and organization on my own. Send me
a pull request containing one or more new files, and I will find a way to
organize it.
