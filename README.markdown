LaTeX Examples
==============

The aim of this repository is to organize, collect, and share a variety of [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) templates that I have used, most likely from old assignments.

To avoid academic integrity issues, I will be modifying assignments before posting them. I will also try to ensure that all content is nevertheless correct.

There is currently no planned structure or hierarchy in this repository, since I'm adding examples as I use them. When things start getting unwieldy, I will start organizing examples into directories.

Current Examples
----------------

* Assignment template
* B-tree
* Binary search tree
* dot2tex - figures drawn in the Dot language
* Entity-Relationship diagram
* Equations
* Extendible hashing
* Pseudocode
* Skip list
* Source code

Usage
-----

1. [Download and install LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html), if you don't already have it. If you don't know LaTeX, [The Not So Short Introduction LaTeX2e](http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf) is a pretty good resource.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Use `pdflatex` to compile the examples
4. ???
5. Profit.

Contributing
------------

One of my goals here is to collect other examples, especially since I am still learning LaTeX.

If you would like to contribute (adding new examples, fixing mistakes, suggesting alternatives, etc), please send me a pull request.

For now, please let me handle directories and organization on my own. Send me a pull request containing one or more new files, and I will find a way to organize it.
